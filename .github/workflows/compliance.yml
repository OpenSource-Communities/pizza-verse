            ## Issue Reference

            In order to be considered for merging, the pull request description must refer to a
            specific issue number.

            This check is looking for a phrase similar to: "Fixes #XYZ" or "Relates to #XYZ" where XYZ is the issue
            number that this PR is meant to address.

            ## Protected Branch

            In order to be considered for merging, the pull request changes must
            not be implemented on the "%branch%" branch.

            We would suggest that you close this pull request, create a new branch, implement your changes, and open a new pull request.
